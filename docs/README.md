WP Box Docs

> The nuts and bolts of running the WP show.

We've put together some docs to explain how to build, deploy and
operate our WPbox server.

- [Architecture][architecture]. A quick overview about how we thought the whole setup.
- [Operations][ops]. An easy and understandale set of instructions about how to spin-off new websites and guide the user thru the daily ops.
- [Bootstrap][bootstrap]. High-level procedure explaining how to build a wordpress box server from scratch using our Flake, on different machines (cloud and local for testing)
